Game entered for the Game Off 2018 jam

Copyright (c) 2018 Pete Goodwin

I'm using Godot V3.1 Alpha 2 for this

I've been playing a few combat card games lately, and wanted to try doing a game jam based on one. This is it... it's based in space (of course) and I'm using ideas from role playing games for the attack modes etc.

The hybrid part is the ability to take two cards and "make hybrid" with them - creating a new card with differing abilities. I've also used rock, paper, scissors to decide how cards interact.

Rock - all planet cards
Scissors - all ship cards
Paper - everything else

So far I have a few special cards, like black hole and comet, that I have to come up with ideas for.
